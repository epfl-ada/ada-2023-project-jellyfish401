Repo for project milestone 2 due **Fri 17 Nov 23:59.**

### Steps
- GH repo
- Select a project: based on factors such as: (1) TA feedback, (2) what are you collectively excited about as a team, (3), feasibility, etc.
- Intimately acquaint yourself with the data: preprocess it, complete all the necessary descriptive statistics tasks, and perform initial analyses
- Feasibility: It is your responsibility to ensure what you propose is feasible given the data (including additional supporting data that you introduce, if any).
- In some cases, restart from Step 2

### P2 deliverables
- You should show us that you have clear project goals
- We expect you to have a pipeline in place, which is fully documented in a Jupyter notebook
- We will grade the correctness, quality of code, and quality of textual descriptions.
  
#### Github deliverables
- README (up to 1000 words) containing the project proposal
- Jupyter notebook containing initial analyses & data handling pipelines
