Repo for project milestone 2 due **Fri 17 Nov 23:59.**

### Steps
- GH repo
- Select a project: based on factors such as: (1) TA feedback, (2) what are you collectively excited about as a team, (3), feasibility, etc.
- Intimately acquaint yourself with the data: preprocess it, complete all the necessary descriptive statistics tasks, and perform initial analyses
- Feasibility: It is your responsibility to ensure what you propose is feasible given the data (including additional supporting data that you introduce, if any).
- In some cases, restart from Step 2

### P2 deliverables
- You should show us that you have clear project goals
- We expect you to have a pipeline in place, which is fully documented in a Jupyter notebook
- We will grade the correctness, quality of code, and quality of textual descriptions.
  
#### Github deliverables
- README (up to 1000 words) containing the project proposal
- Jupyter notebook containing initial analyses & data handling pipelines (We will grade the correctness, quality of code, and quality of textual descriptions)


##### The README.md should contain:
- Title
- Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
- Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
