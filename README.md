## Abstract

Wikipedia serves as a primary information source for both general users and academia, and as a [crucial training database](https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2023/07/12/wikipedias-value-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/) for machine learning algorithms, particularly large language models (LLMs). Biases in Wikipedia articles, such as [gender gaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06307) indicating underrepresentation of women and stereotype perpetuation, not only affect public knowledge but also risk being [amplified a lot by LLMs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3597307) in the future. In addition to gender bias, [bias based on ethnicity and race](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517231165490) represents among others a significant societal challenge. Initially, we considered classifying individuals by ethnicity for analysis, but technical complexities render this approach impractical and ethicaly too delicate. Consequently, our research focuses on country representation within Wikispeedia to examine biases in the dataset and the user navigation patterns.

## Research questions

To analyze country representation bias in the Wikispeedia dataset, we aim to answer three different kind of research questions.

**First**, we focus on the Wikipedia articles about countries and their hyperlink structure in the Wikispeedia dataset:
* Q1: How different are the length of these articles and their number of hyperlinks for each region?
* Q2: How positive or negative is the content of these articles?

**Second**, we want to focus on the pathways that were taken by the players, where the target article of the game is a country:
* Q3: Is there a correlation between the ratio of finished pathways and the region or economic classification of a country?
* Q4: Is there a correlation between the length of the pathway taken respectively the time needed and the region or economic classification of a country?

**Third**, we want to deepen the analysis by controlling for two confounders (population size and economic classification) and answer the following questions:
* Q5: By investigating article length, article sentiment or number of hyperlinks while controlling for population size and economic classification, is there a representation bias based on countries in Wikipedia? 
* Q6: While controlling for as much of the bias in the dataset as we can, do we see additional cultural bias of the players in the pathways they have taken?

To compare all countries (more than 200) would be too confusing, therefore they are grouped by region (17 regions) and by economic developement (4 classifications) and appropriate summary statistics (mean, median etc.) by group are compared.


## Additional datasets
To group the countries by region or economic developement, we use the classifications used by the United Nations (UN):

* classification by region: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/
* classification by gross national income of 2012 (since our dataset has values from 18.08.2008 until 15.01.2014): https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf (Table E, page 6)

Additionally, we also need the population size of each country:
* population size in 2014: http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode%3a1

## Methods

### Pre-proccessing and dataset construction
To analyse the Wikispeedia dataset, we create several DataFrames:

TODO

* path_overview = contains all information about the pathways the player took (start article, target article, duration of the game, etc.) and the shortest possible path
* main_categories = titel of wikipedia article and the main category
* plaintext_articles = title of wikipedia article, its content and the length of the article

The datasets are pre-processed, cleaned, made readable and converted into a DataFrame.


### Statistical analysis

To make statements about the dataset, we define the following metrics, calculated for each country C:

* Length of the Wikipedia article for country C
* Sentiment score of the Wikipedia article for country C using an open source model, provided by https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python.
* Number of hyperlinks in other articles pointing to the article about country C (called links in)
* Number of hyperlinks in the article about country C pointing to other articles (called links out)
* Proportion of completed and uncompleted pathways where country C was the target
* Length and time of pathways targeting country C
* Frequency of article C's involvement in pathways where it was neither the start nor the target

To visualize those different metrics, we group them by region and economic classificiation and report appropriate summary statistics (mean, median etc.)


#### Regression analysis

**TODO**
To assess whether the Wikispeedia dataset (hyperlink structure and article content) exhibits bias, we will control for potential confounding factors by training a predictive model using **multiple linear regression** that accounts for confounders such as population size, economic strength etc. By comparing the model's predicted values against the actual values, we can determine the presence and extent of representation bias.


### Ethical considerations

As recommended by the course staff, we reached out to Dr. CÃ©cile Hardebolle, given the sensitivity surrounding ethical and racial bias. Our ethical considerations are explained at the end of the [datastory](https://colin-a-smyth.github.io/).
